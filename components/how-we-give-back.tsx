              At Thirtysixstudio, we recognize that our industry can perpetuate harm. We believe we have to try and
              reverse some of these imbalances. That's why we're launching SS36, our local social sustainability hub.

              Through SS36, we reinvest some of our revenue and expertise into the communities that shape the culture
              and trends our field so heavily relies on. Our main focus is on bridging gaps for those affected by
              systemic obstacles related to race, sexuality, wealth and gender identity.
